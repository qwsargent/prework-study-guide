          <li>"!DOCTYPE html" declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect to open. In this case, html</li>
          <li>Declarations are not case sensitive, "HTML" elements are case sensitive</li>
          <li>"HTML" attributes define additional information about an element</li>
          <li>Example of attribute: 
            lang="en", which tells the browser which language to use for the webpage, in this case English.
            *Attributes are always defined at the beginning of an element, never at the closing. 
          </li>
          <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated withe a website</li>
          <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage </li>
          <li>The "link" element connnects an external resource to the HTML document,
            like the CSS code we linked to this webpage </li>
            <li>The "meta" element defines metadata such as character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>

          <li>A period preceeding an attribute will designate it as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class attribute will gain the property assigned from the CSS</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In JavaScript, we declare a variable by using the word var, after var we give the variable a name</li>
          <li>After the variable is named we use an assignment operator = to assign specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
          <li>console.log method outputs a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li>Each ling of JavaScript must end in a semicolon</li>
          <li>All string variables are surrounded by quotation marks</li>
          <li>An "if" statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code</li>
          <li>When the computer encounters an "if" statement, it will check to see if the condition of the code is truthy. If it is, it will run  the code provided. If the condition is not truthy, the computer will skip the code</li>
          <li>JavaScript "if" statements can also be accompanied by "else if" statements if more than one condition is wanted</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, typically to hold data that is related in some way</li>
          <li>"for" loops use a predictable patter of indices to perform a task on all items in an array by allowing a single block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional "if" statement, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of the code a specific number of times</li>
          <li>You can define the length of an array by using the "length" command</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a task</li>
          <li>To declare a function, use the "function" key word, followed by its unique name in parentheses. Then add "{}" that contain the code for the task you want to perform</li>
