# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description


This webpage was created to provide some basic introductory information on Github, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This webpage will help students of online coding bootcamps to work through prework, and get a basic understanding of above topics. Building this webpage taught me a lot about basic HTML formatting, how to perform Github flow, CSS styling, and console.log operations from JavaScript.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
